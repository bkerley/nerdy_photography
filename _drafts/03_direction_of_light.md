# Direction of Light

In a single medium, you can think of light as a "ray," a pure mathematical
construct of half of an infinite line, originating at a point.

However, reality isn't a single medium and infinite rays, it's got stuff.
When light changes media (i.e. from open air to a red chromed teapot),
it reflects and refracts, and brings information about that media along in
the new angles and colors.

Not everything in our reality is perfectly reflective; matte objects scatter
their reflected light in multiple directions.

Most light isn't a single ray, but an uncountable volume of rays, hitting many
points on an object all at once, producing a new volume of rays. Once you add
more objects to the scene, you can get an extremely rich understanding of
how those objects relate to each other and the space they're in with just a
small sample of reflected rays.

Sampling these rays is usually done with a lens.
"Lens" is going to be confusing; not just because of the physics, but first
because of conflicting jargon. In physics jargon, "lens" often means a single
piece of material that refracts light. In photography jargon, "lens" usually
means an assembly of multiple pieces of material that refract light.
For this document, I'm going to try to stick to:

* **Element**, a single piece of refractive material
* **Group**, one or more elements permanently cemented together
* **Assembly** or **system**, a collection of groups packaged together,
  that may support adjusting their configuration to control optical properties

The glass part of a monocle is an element and a group, and with a frame it's
an assembly. A [camera lens assembly][big_boi]
that you'd swap on to or off of a camera
might have
over twenty elements organized into over a dozen groups.
