# Foreword

Nerdy Photography is the guide to the physics and engineering of photography
that I wanted; I've taken a few physics classes, and have some ideas about
how things work, but need both a translation into photography jargon and
specific mentions of how physical phenomenae map to the practical aspects
of capturing images.

Nerdy Photography is not primarily about the art of photography. Art is fickle,
enduring, individual, and universal. There are many kinds of photographic art,
and I've only barely scratched the surface in my exploration of it.

Nerdy Photography is absolutely not about the business of photography. I don't
know about this at all.
