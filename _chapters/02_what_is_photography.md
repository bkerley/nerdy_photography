# What is Photography?

Photography is the science, technology, and art of capturing a slice of light
into an image that can be reproduced and shared.

## What is Light?

Photons or waves or something. It's confusing because different properties and
ways of reasoning about it work better with different models. Understanding
[chromatic abberation][chromabb] might be more intuitive if you think of
different energies (colors) of photon being refracted differently by a lens,
but understanding [diffraction][diffract] might be more intuitive thinking
about wave interference.

[chromabb]: XXXX
[diffract]: XXXX

Light has different colors. If you've seen a rainbow, a diagram of the
electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, or the cover art for "The Dark Side of the Moon,"
you're familiar with how these colors relate and fade into each other as they
go from red, through orange to yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
You can make more than just these pure hues by mixing colors of light, using
an [additive color][addcolor] model to reason about it. Most computer displays
use this, by mixing the relative brightness of red, green, and blue emitters
on a panel.

You can also make color by controlling what colors of light bounce off a
surface or allowed through a medium. If you shine white light through a red
filter on to a blue object, the blue object will appear black, since all the
light that would normally reflect off it has been subtracted. This is a
[subtractive color][subcolor] model. Printed and painted media use this;
color printing tends to use cyan, magenta, and yellow colors (and often
black for when all the color should be subtracted).

When light hits something and bounces off, the way in which it bounces off
is important. If it scatters off in random directions, like when it hits cheap
paper, we think of that as "diffuse reflection."
 If the reflection
is coherent and doesn't go in random directions, it's "specular reflection."
Mirrors are specularly reflective.

When light hits something and goes into it, it changes direction and
velocity, or "refracts." You can see
refraction when looking at stuff in water, looking through heat distortion,
and in mirages.

## Capturing Light

You can make things that react to light. Early photography used
chemicals on some substrate to capture images; first shadows of objects placed
right on top of silver-based chemicals, and then [nature scenes][legras]
imaged on [Bitumen of Judea][bitumen]
as seen through a lens and
a tiny hole in a dark chamber called a "camera obscūra."

In the centuries since, cameras have evolved considerably. Lenses are
manufactured with incredible precision, and complex mechanisms are used to
adjust their spacing to achieve precise refractive properties. No longer
do you have
to wash soluble bitumen away with oil of lavender to develop an image,
and you can capture that image in a thousandth of a second.

The fundamentals are still the same though:

1. Use a lens to gather light from the environment and direct it into the
   camera
2. Cohere an image out of the gathered light using an "aperture," or small
   hole
3. Use the cohered light to change properties on your photographic medium
4. Process that medium into an image.

## Photographic Media and Processing

Chemical films on a substrate are how images have been captured for most of
the history of photography. In the camera, a photon crashes into a silver
halide crystal (a crystal with silver atoms and halogen atoms) and knocks an
electron to a "sensitivity center." The halogen atom wanders off, the silver
atom chases its electron to the sensitivty center, and as silver atoms mash
together at that site, that grain becomes the "latent image." Later on,
the film gets processed by a series of stages, and is eventually rendered into
a visible image of what the camera originally captured.
These chemical processes take time, use lots of nasty chemicals, and cost
a not-insignificant amount of money.

Electronic photography (including digital photography) also involves light
changing the distribution of electrons in a photographic medium, but the
latent image
is read out electrically, and the media can be reset and used again. Electronic
imaging was being researched over a century ago, but its use has skyrocketed
in the 21st century because computing is an unstoppable *katamari*[^katamari],
rolling up and entangling photography with everything else computers are
good at (communication, information storage, data processing, the group
chat).

[^katamari]: "clump," "塊," from "Katamari Damacy," the game about rolling up
    all the stuff in the world into a big ball.
